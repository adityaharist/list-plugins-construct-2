# list-plugins-construct-2
Ya begitulah... construct 2 tidak akan dilanjutkan lagi proyeknya terakhir 21 Juli 2021. Jadi sedih mimin :'(    
    
Boleh didownload. Silahkan. Asal jangan pada rebutan. Ok. Sip. Mantap.    

How to use this files:
Old addons    
Older addons are usually just a collection of files. You need to close Construct 2 and copy the folders to the install directory - one of the following depending on whether it's a plugin or behavior:    
<install path>\exporters\html5\plugins    
    
or    
    
<install path>\exporters\html5\behaviors
    
In these folders each plugin and behavior has its own folder with a couple of files in it. Copy the plugin or behavior you've downloaded there, launch C2 again, and you should see it in the editor!    
    
Effects are slightly different: they're just a .fx and .xml file. These go in the effects subfolder in the install directory.    
    
Enjoy!
